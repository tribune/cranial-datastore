About Cranial
======================

Cranial is a Framework and Toolkit for building distributed applications and
microservices in Python, with a particular focus on services delivering
predictions from online learning models.

The machine learning components do not provide algorithms or models like
SciKitLearn or Tensorflow or Spark or H2O, but instead provide wrappers so that
models and pipelines created by these tools can be deployed and combined in
standardized ways.

A slide deck with detailed diagrams of Cranial architecture can be found here:

The Cranial Ontology is now formalized in OWL.
